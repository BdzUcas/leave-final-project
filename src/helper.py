# This is a library of helpful functions made by BDZ.
# Anyone is welcome to use any of them for any purpose.
# Here's a quick overview of all of them:
# Hit alt+z to wrap text and make this actually readable
# btw if you are making a terminal-based program please read f(), choice_input(), int_input(), and list_choice() because they are UNBELIEVABLY useful. I use them all the time. Please do yourself a favor and read them.
# and if you are using tkinter check out gui() as it is pretty useful

# f() takes two arguments, one for a format and the second for text. It returns the text with the given format, and defaults to an empty string if no text is provided. Formats can be colors like "gray" or "blue" or a couple special ones like "clear" to clear the screen or "###" to print a gray triple #

# uinput() takes a user input in a pretty way, strips it, and converts it to lowercase.

# stringify() takes any list and converts it entirely to strings. Somewhat useful for generating lists of number strings with range. It also lowers all items.

# chance() takes a float between 0 and 1 and returns true x percent of the time. so 0.25 would be a 25% chance to return true

# choice_input() is probably the most useful. It takes a list of strings as the first argument and a prompt as the second (optional), and an error message as the third input (optional). It takes a user inputs until the input matches one of the items in the list. So if you wanted the user to pick a number from 1-4, you could say choice_input([1,2,3,4],"Pick a number from 1-4: "). It automatically lowers the input, so don't put in options with uppercase letters, and stringifies the list (so numbers are okay in the list, as they'll be converted to strings). The optional third argument is an error message to be displayed if the input does not match something from the list.

# int_input() is similar to choice input, but doesn't take the first argument. Instead, it only accepts inputs that can be converted to a float (ie 1, 7.6, -12 would all be valid). It automatically converts it to a float for you. It also accepts an optional max and min argument.(min defaults to 0). Arguments in order are: prompt, error, max, min. All are optional

# csv_to_dictionary accepts the file path to a csv file and returns a list of dictionaries with the content of the csv. Pretty self explanatory.

# save_csv() is the opposite of csv_to_dictionary(), it takes a dictionary as the first argument and a file path as the second.

# uniprint accepts anything. ANYTHING. and it pretty prints it. You could nest tuples in sets in dictionaries in dictionaries full of floats, integers, whatever. It will print it with coloring and indentation.

# search() takes a list of dictionaries (such as from csv_to_dictionary()) and asks the user for a prompt. Then it returns a list of all the dictionaries that contain that prompt in any of their values.

# list_choice() is incredibly useful. It accepts a list and prompt and prints the prompt, then each item in the list with a number assigned. Then it asks the user for a choice, which can be a number assigned to a choice or one of the choices. It returns what they chose. Super useful for making menus, to make a menu where the user picks between search, add, or quit you would use just this one line of code: choice = list_input(['search','add','quit'],'What would you like to do?')

# gui() texts a list of strings to display as lines of text and a list of strings to display as buttons. It will create a gui with a width and height that perfectly fits the displayed text and buttons. It returns the text on whichever button the user clicks.
